    <li>This is a 2D platformer, your goal is to go to the top-right.</li>

    <li>Sometimes you have to go left a bit before jumping up-right to get over a ledge.</li>

    <li>The down button does nothing.</li>

    <li>
      You can hear crumbling rocks on the right audio channel when you‚Äôre almost falling off a ledge to your right.
    </li>

    <li>When you hear your head bump above you, try to move slowly to the left until you don‚Äôt hear the bump, then jump
      and move right at the same time to land on the ledge above you.</li>

    <li>The strong wind sounds always mean you should be careful, jump over, or stay away. You might need to get close
      to them to be able to jump over them. The rock crumbling sound is your safety net.</li>

    <li>The snakes just snarl, I was thinking of maybe making them chase you and kill you, but ran out of time.</li>

    <li>
      You can hear a "whoa" sound when you slip off a ledge.
    </li>

    <li>
      When you land, you'll hear a piano note. Its octave corresponds to how high the floor is.
    </li>

    <li>If you beat the game, you‚Äôll learn how to turn on the visual mode to see the level design.</li>

    <li>There are 4 sections: ledge, the gap (just one hole in the middle), snakes, platforms. The last section of
      platforms you need to climb to the top and jump. The platforms are just like the first section, but you need to do
      it 4 times, and then just walk to the right in the end. Just stay away from the windy ledges.</li>

    <li>Each section has a safety wall to its left, you can always walk left at the start of a section and hear the left
      wall sound, so you can re-orient yourself.</li>

    <li>Here is a <a href="./assets/tilemaps/platformer.png">map</a></li>
